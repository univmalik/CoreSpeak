# Privacy Policy for **Spanish Grammar – Intermediate**

**Effective Date:** September 15, 2025  
**Developer/Controller:** Deeper Language (deeperlanguage@gmail.com)

This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information in connection with the **Spanish Grammar – 45 Lessons** mobile application (the “App”).

We are committed to protecting your privacy. This policy describes what the App does and does **not** collect, how advertising works, and your choices.

---

## 1) What We **Do Not** Collect
The App has **no accounts** and **no in-app purchases**. We do **not** ask you to register, sign in, or provide personal details. We do not collect or store on our servers:

- Your name, email address, phone number, or postal address  
- Your precise (GPS) location  
- Your contacts or calendar  
- Photos, media, or files (beyond lesson assets packaged with the App)  
- Biometric data  
- Any user-generated content uploaded to our servers (we have no backend)

We also do not integrate analytics or crash-reporting SDKs that would transmit your usage to us.

---

## 2) Data Stored **Locally** on Your Device
The App saves a small amount of data **only on your device** (e.g., via Android SharedPreferences) to power core features:

- Lesson progress, best quiz scores, completion flags  
- UI preferences (e.g., last opened lesson)

This local data is not transmitted to us. You can delete it by clearing the App’s data or uninstalling the App.

---

## 3) Advertising (Ad-Supported App)
The App displays advertising to keep it free. We use third-party ad providers (e.g., Google AdMob). These providers may collect information independently to deliver, limit, and measure ads, such as:

- **Advertising identifiers** (e.g., Android Advertising ID)  
- **Approximate location** inferred from IP address  
- **Device and network info** (device model, language, app version, IP, carrier, network type)  
- **Ad interaction data** (impressions, clicks, error signals within the ad SDK)

This data collection is performed **by the ad provider**, under its own privacy policy, and helps show relevant ads, perform frequency capping, and detect fraud.

### Your Choices for Ads
- **EEA/UK (GDPR):** Where required, the App may present a consent prompt. If you decline consent, you’ll receive **non-personalized** ads. You can change your choice later in the App (if a consent dialog is provided) or in your device’s ad settings.  
- **Android Advertising ID:** You can **reset** or **delete** your Advertising ID in device settings and limit ad personalization in Google settings.  
- **Regional rights (e.g., CCPA/CPRA USA):** You may have rights to opt out of “sale”/“sharing” for cross-context behavioral advertising. Use your device/Google ad settings to limit personalization.

> We do not control third-party ad providers’ data practices. Review their policies to understand how they process your data.

---

## 4) Permissions
To show ads and open external links, the App may require:
- **INTERNET** – load ads and any external web content you choose to open  
- **ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE** – check connectivity before requesting ads

We **do not** request precise location permissions (e.g., ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION).

---

## 5) Web Content & External Links
Lessons are rendered locally in a WebView without JavaScript for reading content. Some lessons may contain links to external sites you choose to open. Those sites are operated by third parties with their own privacy practices. We are not responsible for their content or policies.

---

## 6) Data Sharing
- We do **not** sell or rent your personal data.  
- We do **not** share locally stored progress/preferences with third parties.  
- **Ad providers** receive data directly from your device as described in Section 3.  
- We may disclose information if required by law (e.g., to comply with a subpoena, court order, or legal process) or to protect rights, safety, or investigate fraud.

---

## 7) Data Security & Retention
- **Local data:** Stored on your device until you delete it (clear App data or uninstall).  
- **Ad data:** Managed and retained by the ad provider under its policies.  
- We use reasonable safeguards within our control, but no method of storage or transmission is 100% secure.

---

## 8) Children’s Privacy
This App is intended for a general audience and is **not** directed to children under 13 (or the relevant age in your jurisdiction). We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you believe a child has provided personal information via ads or otherwise, contact us and the relevant ad provider to request deletion.

---

## 9) International Transfers
Ad providers may process and store data on servers located outside your country. Their use of your information is governed by their privacy policies and applicable laws.

---

## 10) Changes to This Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will post updates within the App or on the store listing and revise the **Effective Date** above. Please review it periodically.
