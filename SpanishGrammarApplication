# Privacy Policy for **Spanish Grammar – Intermediate** (iOS)

**Effective Date:** October 9, 2025
**Developer/Controller:** Deeper Language ([deeperlanguage@gmail.com](mailto:deeperlanguage@gmail.com))

This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information in connection with the **Spanish Grammar – 45 Lessons** iOS application (the “App”) distributed on the **Apple App Store**.

We are committed to protecting your privacy. This policy describes what the App does and does **not** collect and your choices.

---

## 1) What We **Do Not** Collect

The App has **no accounts**, **no in-app purchases**, and **no ads**. We do **not** ask you to register, sign in, or provide personal details. We do not collect or store on our servers:

* Your name, email address, phone number, or postal address
* Your precise (GPS) location
* Your contacts or calendar
* Photos, media, microphone, or camera data
* Health, Fitness, or Home data
* Identifiers used for tracking or advertising (e.g., **IDFA**)
* Any user-generated content uploaded to our servers (we have **no backend**)

We also do **not** integrate third-party analytics, advertising, or crash-reporting SDKs that would transmit your usage to us.

> **System note:** If you’ve opted in to share diagnostics with developers at the **iOS system level**, Apple may provide us with **de-identified** crash logs. We do not attempt to link these logs to you.

---

## 2) Data Stored **Locally** on Your Device

The App saves a small amount of data **only on your device** (e.g., via iOS **UserDefaults** or local files) to power core features:

* Lesson progress, best quiz scores, completion flags
* UI preferences (e.g., last opened lesson)

This local data is **not** transmitted to us. You can remove it by **deleting the App** from your device. If your device is backed up to **iCloud** or a computer, deleting related backups will also remove saved data there.

---

## 3) Permissions & System Access

* The App does **not** request access to sensitive iOS permissions such as **Location**, **Contacts**, **Photos**, **Camera**, **Microphone**, **Bluetooth**, or **Motion & Fitness**.
* The App does **not** request “Allow App to Track” (App Tracking Transparency) because we do **not** track users across apps or websites.
* The App does **not** require a network connection and does **not** make network requests.

---

## 4) Web Content & External Links

* Lesson content is rendered locally on the device.
* The App contains **no external links** and does **not** open Safari or any third-party websites.

---

## 5) Data Sharing

* We do **not** sell or rent your personal data.
* We do **not** share locally stored progress or preferences with third parties.
* We may disclose information if required by law (e.g., to comply with a subpoena, court order, or legal process) or to protect rights, safety, or investigate fraud.

---

## 6) Data Security & Retention

* **Local data:** Stored on your device until you delete it (by deleting the App).
* We use reasonable safeguards within our control, but no method of storage or transmission is 100% secure.

---

## 7) Children’s Privacy

This App is intended for a general audience and is **not** directed to children under 13 (or the relevant age in your jurisdiction). We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you believe a child has provided personal information, contact us to request deletion.

---

## 8) International Transfers

We do **not** transfer your data internationally. No data leaves your device.

---

## 9) App Store “App Privacy” Disclosure

In **App Store Connect**, this version is designated as:

* **Data Not Collected** and **No Tracking**, based on the App’s behavior described above.

If the App’s features change (for example, adding sign-in, analytics, ads, or cloud sync), we will update both this policy and the App Privacy disclosure accordingly.

---

## 10) Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will post updates within the App or on the store listing and revise the **Effective Date** above. Please review it periodically.
