Privacy Policy for **French Grammar – Intermediate (iOS)**

**Effective Date:** October 20, 2025
**Developer/Controller:** Deeper Language ([deeperlanguage@gmail.com](mailto:deeperlanguage@gmail.com))

This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information in connection with the **French Grammar – Intermediate** iOS application (the “App”) distributed on the Apple App Store.

We are committed to protecting your privacy. This policy describes what the App does and does not collect and your choices.

⸻

## 1) What We Do Not Collect

The App has no accounts, no ads, and no tracking.
It includes a one-time in-app purchase to unlock all lessons, but we do not collect or store your purchase details personally.

We do not ask you to register, sign in, or provide personal details.
We do not collect or store on our servers:

* Your name, email address, phone number, or postal address
* Your precise (GPS) location
* Your contacts or calendar
* Photos, media, microphone, or camera data
* Health, Fitness, or Home data
* Identifiers used for tracking or advertising (e.g., IDFA)
* Any user-generated content uploaded to our servers (we have no backend)

We also do not integrate third-party analytics, advertising, or crash-reporting SDKs that would transmit your usage to us.

**System note:** If you’ve opted in to share diagnostics with developers at the iOS system level, Apple may provide us with de-identified crash logs. We do not attempt to link these logs to you.

⸻

## 2) In-App Purchases

The App offers a single one-time in-app purchase to unlock all lessons.
Purchases are processed securely through Apple’s App Store payment system — we do not handle or store your payment information directly.

Apple provides us only with anonymous confirmation that a purchase or restore was successful (no credit card, name, or Apple ID details are ever shared with us).

If you reinstall the App or switch devices, you can use the “Restore Purchases” option to regain access using your Apple ID credentials.
We do not manage or see those credentials.

⸻

## 3) Data Stored Locally on Your Device

The App saves a small amount of data only on your device (e.g., via iOS UserDefaults or local files) to power core features:

* Lesson progress, best quiz scores, completion flags
* Purchase unlock status
* UI preferences (e.g., last opened lesson)

This local data is not transmitted to us.
You can remove it by deleting the App from your device.
If your device is backed up to iCloud or a computer, deleting related backups will also remove saved data there.

⸻

## 4) Permissions & System Access

* The App does not request access to sensitive iOS permissions such as Location, Contacts, Photos, Camera, Microphone, Bluetooth, or Motion & Fitness.
* The App does not request “Allow App to Track” (App Tracking Transparency) because we do not track users across apps or websites.
* The App works offline and does not make network requests.

⸻

## 5) Web Content & External Links

* Lesson content is rendered locally on the device.
* The App contains no external links and does not open Safari or any third-party websites.

⸻

## 6) Data Sharing

* We do not sell, rent, or share your personal data.
* We do not share your local progress or purchase status with third parties.
* We may disclose information if required by law (e.g., to comply with a subpoena, court order, or legal process) or to protect rights, safety, or investigate fraud.

⸻

## 7) Data Security & Retention

* **Local data:** Stored only on your device until you delete it.
* We use reasonable safeguards within our control, but no method of storage or transmission is 100% secure.

⸻

## 8) Children’s Privacy

This App is intended for a general audience and is not directed to children under 13 (or the relevant age in your jurisdiction).
We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.
If you believe a child has provided personal information, contact us to request deletion.

⸻

## 9) International Transfers

We do not transfer your data internationally. No data leaves your device.

⸻

## 10) App Store “App Privacy” Disclosure

In App Store Connect, this version is designated as:

* **Data Not Collected** and **No Tracking**,
  except for purchase processing handled solely by Apple’s App Store infrastructure.

If the App’s features change (e.g., adding sign-in, analytics, ads, or cloud sync), we will update both this policy and the App Privacy disclosure accordingly.

⸻

## 11) Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time.
We will post updates within the App or on the store listing and revise the Effective Date above.
Please review it periodically.
