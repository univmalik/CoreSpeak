# Privacy Policy for **French – Complete Course**

**Effective Date:** January 9, 2026

This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information in connection with the **French – Complete Course** mobile application (the "App").

We are committed to protecting your privacy. This policy describes what the App does and does **not** collect and your choices.

---

## 1) What We **Do Not** Collect

The App has **no accounts**. We do **not** ask you to register, sign in, or provide personal details. We do not collect or store on our servers:

* Your name, email address, phone number, or postal address
* Your precise (GPS) location
* Your contacts or calendar
* Photos, media, or files (beyond lesson assets packaged with the App)
* Biometric data
* Any user-generated content uploaded to our servers (we have no backend)

We also do not integrate analytics or crash-reporting SDKs that would transmit your usage to us.

---

## 2) Purchases, Subscriptions, and Payments (App Store)

The App offers **monthly subscriptions** and a **one-time purchase** to unlock premium content.

* **Payments are processed by the App Store**, not by us.
* We do **not** receive or store your payment card details or billing address.
* Apple may process information necessary to complete transactions and manage subscriptions (such as purchase history, region, and device/account identifiers) under its own privacy policy.

To provide access to premium content, the App may check your **purchase/subscription status** with the App Store and store an "unlocked/active" flag **locally on your device**. We do not send your purchase information to our own servers.

---

## 3) Data Stored **Locally** on Your Device

The App saves a small amount of data **only on your device** (e.g., via iOS UserDefaults / local storage) to power core features:

* Lesson progress, best quiz scores, completion flags
* UI preferences (e.g., last opened lesson, theme settings)
* Premium access state (e.g., "premium unlocked" after a valid purchase/subscription)

This local data is not transmitted to us. You can delete it by deleting the App from your device.

---

## 4) Permissions

The App does not request any special permissions beyond basic network access:

* **Network Access** – to connect to the App Store for purchases/subscription checks and to open external web content you choose to open

We **do not** request location permissions or access to your photos, camera, microphone, contacts, or other sensitive data.

---

## 5) Web Content & External Links

Lessons are primarily rendered locally for reading. Some lessons may contain links to external sites you choose to open. Those sites are operated by third parties with their own privacy practices. We are not responsible for their content or policies.

---

## 6) Data Sharing

* We do **not** sell or rent your personal data.
* We do **not** share your locally stored progress/preferences with third parties.
* **Apple** processes purchase/subscription transactions as an independent controller under its own policies.
* We may disclose information if required by law (e.g., to comply with a subpoena, court order, or legal process) or to protect rights, safety, or investigate fraud.

---

## 7) Data Security & Retention

* **Local data:** Stored on your device until you delete it (delete the App).
* We use reasonable safeguards within our control, but no method of storage or transmission is 100% secure.

---

## 8) Children's Privacy

This App is intended for a general audience and is **not** directed to children under 13 (or the relevant age in your jurisdiction). We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you believe a child has provided personal information, contact us to request deletion.

---

## 9) International Transfers

The App Store and external websites you visit may process and store data on servers located outside your country. Their use of your information is governed by their privacy policies and applicable laws.

---

## 10) Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will post updates within the App or on the App Store listing and revise the **Effective Date** above. Please review it periodically.
